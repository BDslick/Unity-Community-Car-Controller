This project intends to provide a car controller that the community can use. As the name suggests, it will be a community effort. If you have any suggestions, feel free to let me know.

The project so far consists of the following scripts:
CommunityCarController.cs - The main controller
CommunityCarEngine.cs - The engine component
CommunityCarFuelTank.cs - The fuel component, planned to provide gas and diesel
CommunityCarSuspension.cs - The suspension component, planned to provide different suspension types
CommunityTransmission.cs - The transmission component, planned to provide different transmission types
CommunityWheelCollider.cs - Wheel collider, planned to be volumetric
